Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Secure Digital Voting System (TGPDS22)
Purpose
The Secure Digital Voting System (TGPDS22) is a blockchain-based platform designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. It reduces fraud and increases voter trust through immutable vote recording, secure authentication, and real-time result verification.

Scope
The system targets governments, organizations, and communities, providing a decentralized, auditable voting solution that addresses traditional voting flaws like fraud and lack of transparency.

Functional Requirements
Voter Registration: Register eligible voters with unique blockchain credentials.
Authentication: Verify voter identity securely to prevent unauthorized access.
Vote Casting: Record votes as immutable blockchain transactions via a user-friendly interface.
Vote Tallying: Automatically tally votes in real-time using smart contracts.
Result Verification: Enable public verification of results via a transparent blockchain ledger.
Election Management: Allow admins to set up, monitor, and close elections.
Security: Ensure anonymity, prevent double-voting, and protect against fraud.
Non-Functional Requirements
Security: Use encryption and cryptography to safeguard data and votes.
Scalability: Handle large voter volumes efficiently.
Usability: Provide an intuitive interface for all users.
Availability: Operate 24/7 during voting periods (e.g., as of March 28, 2025).
Transparency: Offer a publicly auditable process.
Performance: Deliver real-time updates with minimal delays.
Maintainability: Use modular design for easy updates.
Assumptions
Uses a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger).
Requires internet access for voters and admins.
Complies with relevant voting laws.
Constraints
Votes are immutable once recorded.
Blockchain transaction costs and scalability may limit performance.
Must balance voter anonymity with verification needs.
External Interfaces
User Interfaces: Web/mobile app for voters, admin dashboard.
Blockchain API: For transaction recording and retrieval (e.g., Web3.js).
Identity System: For voter credential issuance.
System Requirements
Software: Node.js, blockchain client (e.g., Geth), front-end framework (e.g., React).
Hardware: Servers for app and blockchain nodes, client devices for users.
Network: Secure internet with HTTPS/SSL.
Acceptance Criteria
Successful voter registration and authentication.
Accurate, tamper-proof vote recording and real-time tallying.
Publicly verifiable results with voter confirmation.
No security breaches or performance issues under load.
Risks and Mitigation
Security Breach: Audit and test rigorously.
Scalability: Optimize blockchain for high loads.
Usability: Test and refine UI with user feedback.
Compliance: Consult legal experts.
Conclusion
This SRS outlines a robust framework for TGPDS22, ensuring a secure, transparent, and trustworthy voting system using blockchain technology.
